# Exercise 3

**Monty Hall**
   Write a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through
   simulation. The function takes two arguments `ndoors` and
   `ntrials`, representing the number of doors in the experiment and
   the number of trails in a simulation, respectively. The function
   should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and
   no-switch strategy. Apply your function with 3 doors and 5 doors,
   both with 1000 trials. Include sufficient text around the code to
   explain your them.
