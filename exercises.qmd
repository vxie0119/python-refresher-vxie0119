# Exercise 3

**Monty Hall**
   Write a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through
   simulation. The function takes two arguments `ndoors` and
   `ntrials`, representing the number of doors in the experiment and
   the number of trails in a simulation, respectively. The function
   should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and
   no-switch strategy. Apply your function with 3 doors and 5 doors,
   both with 1000 trials. Include sufficient text around the code to
   explain your them.

```{python}
import random
random.seed(3255)

def monty_hall(ndoors, ntrials):
    # initialize a counter for wins
    switch_wins = 0
    no_switch_wins = 0

    for i in range(ntrials):
        # depending on number of doors, will make one door have a prize
        doors = ['goat'] * (ndoors-1) + ['car']

        # shuffles the doors
        random.shuffle(doors)

        # random choice based on number of doors
        choice = random.randint(0, ndoors-1)

        # opens door with goat behind it
        monty_choices = [i for i in range(ndoors) if i != choice and doors[i] == 'goat']
        monty_open = random.choice(monty_choices)

        # strategy of switch or no switch
        switch_choice = [i for i in range(ndoors) if i != choice and i != monty_open]

        # checks if player wins with switch strategy
        if doors[random.choice(switch_choice)] == 'car':
            switch_wins += 1

        # checks if player wins with no switch strategy
        if doors[choice] == 'car':
            no_switch_wins += 1

    switch_win_percentage = (switch_wins/ntrials) * 100
    no_switch_win_percentage = (no_switch_wins/ntrials) * 100

    return switch_win_percentage, no_switch_win_percentage

# simulation with 3 doors and 5 doors for 1000 trials
switch_wins_3, no_switch_wins_3 = monty_hall(3, 1000)
switch_wins_5, no_switch_wins_5 = monty_hall(5, 1000)

print("Monty Hall Simulation Results")
print("3 Door - Switch Strategy Win Proportion: {:.1f}%".format(switch_wins_3))
print("3 Door - No Switch Strategy Win Proportion: {:.1f}%".format(no_switch_wins_3))
print("5 Door - Switch Strategy Win Proportion: {:.1f}%".format(switch_wins_5))
print("5 Door - No Switch Strategy Win Proportion: {:.1f}%".format(no_switch_wins_5))
